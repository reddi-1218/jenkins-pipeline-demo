# Jenkins Pipeline Demo

This repository demonstrates a full CI/CD pipeline using **Jenkins**, **Docker**, and a simple **Node.js** application.

## How It Works

1. Jenkins checks out the code from GitHub.  
2. Installs dependencies with `npm install`.  
3. Runs tests (`npm test`).  
4. Builds a Docker image tagged as `chanikya1218/myimage:<build_number>`.  
5. Logs into Docker Hub using credentials stored in Jenkins.  
6. Pushes the image to Docker Hub.  
7. Deploys by running a container (removing any previous version).  
8. Reports final status (SUCCESS / FAILURE).

## Prerequisites

- Jenkins server that can run Docker commands  
- A Jenkins credential (ID: `dockerhub_creds`) with:  
  - Username: **your Docker Hub username** (not your email)  
  - Password / Secret: a **Docker Hub Personal Access Token (PAT)** with **read + write + delete** scopes  
- Docker Hub repository accessible to your account

## Local Testing

To test locally without Jenkins:

```bash
docker build -t chanikya1218/myimage:local .
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 chanikya1218/myimage:local
